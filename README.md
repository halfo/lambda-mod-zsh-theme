## Configuring the amount of dir levels

By default only the last three directories are shown in the prompt. The amount of levels can be
configured by setting `LAMBDA_MOD_N_DIR_LEVELS` before loading the prompt:

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
export LAMBDA_MOD_N_DIR_LEVELS=10

# load `lambda-mod` and `oh-my-zsh`
```

You can display the hostname after the username with a "@" separator by setting:

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc
export LAMBDA_MOD_HOST_SUF=true

# load `lambda-mod` and `oh-my-zsh`
```
